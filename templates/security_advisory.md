# Summary

Usually about a paragraph in length, we expect an easy to digest summary of the vulnerability here. Something we can explain to our peers or use to motivate a patching request or update.

## Severity & Impact

Use your judgement to determine how severe the vulnerability is here. A discussion about its impact and potential role in an attack can also be used to motivate your assessment here. No need to be dramatic; be factual, everyone will thank you for it.

# Proof of Concept

This here is your `PoC.$ext`, and its various artifacts needed to reproduce the vulnerability:
```
#include funcode
```

# Analysis

Take your time here, this will be the meat of your report.

## Background

Any information useful to understand the vulnerability. Context will help for non-initiated.

## Vulnerability Details

Adjust these titles as you see fit, but a detailed explanation as to why this is a vulnerability, and where it is, and how to exploit it is commendable.

## Mitigation / Patching

Assuming we can fix this, or at least mitigate the issue, it would be nice to mention it here. A short discussion and inclusion of the product owners's patching activity can be discussed here as well.

# Timeline and Credits

When was this discovered? reported? patched under embargo? rolled out publicly? You may also include potential pings and repeated communications here as well; it is important information for the community to know what kind of response a project/product owner provides when informed of vulnerabilities.
