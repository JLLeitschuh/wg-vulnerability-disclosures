## Agenda

- Review existing vulnerability disclosure formats (maintainer -> world)
  _[Python](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vulnerabilities.html)_
  NodeJS samples \* core:

              [https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/vuln/core/65.json](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/vuln/core/65.json) \

  [https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/vuln/core/55.json](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/vuln/core/55.json)

          *   npm: [https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/vuln/npm/100.json](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/vuln/npm/100.json)
      *   [GitHub](https://gist-playground.github.com/collaborate/3e779e8c7e7cdf26293e65919adb86cff7f2aa0e)

      *   [CVE Automation Working Group Schema](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/blob/master/cve_json_schema/v5.x_discuss/cve510.schema)

- Review existing vulnerability report formats (researcher -> maintainer)
  - HackerOne:
- POST (Create) Vulnerability Report: [https://api.hackerone.com/core-resources/#reports-create-report](https://api.hackerone.com/core-resources/#reports-create-report) \
  (existing format, uses some HackerOne-specific terminology today)
  - GET (Read) Vulnerability Report: [https://api.hackerone.com/reference/#report](https://api.hackerone.com/reference/#report)
  - GitHub: at the outset, our private vulnerability reports will have the same set of metadata as our [Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) \* [OWASP cheat sheet](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/pull/366/files)
- Create lists of the metadata we think all:
  - All disclosures and reports should share
  - All disclosures should share
  - All reports should share
- Create agenda for next meeting
  - Finishing the table 👇🏻 (start at remediation section)
  - Am I actually vulnerable?
- Future meetings
  - How do you update a report, and how can I trust your update? - is Git a model here?

## Notes

We spent the entirety of the meeting reviewing all of the various disclosure/report forms listed in the ☝️ agenda and combining them into the following list of metadata.

### Outcomes

- We agreed that we would put our weight behind the **Package URL (PURL)** spec as a standard way to refer to a package ecosystem, host, name, and version. In the coming weeks, all of us that own vulnerability reports or disclosures will need to assess how best to do so.

### Table column descriptions

- The disclosure and report columns are checked if we thought the metadata was appropriate for a vulnerability disclosure (maintainer -> world) and/or a vulnerability report (researcher -> maintainer), respectively.
- The auto? column indicates that a column should/shouldn’t be usable by automation.

### Table

Remains in Google Docs: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w_I7Uf0Vy9o_PjF9KnhVZzEdust0S3yLU0WLFkEYjcc/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w_I7Uf0Vy9o_PjF9KnhVZzEdust0S3yLU0WLFkEYjcc/edit#)
