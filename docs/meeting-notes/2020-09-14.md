- Overview of the disclosure process in Arch Linux - Morten Linderud - (@Foxboron) - showed their approach
  - “Web dashboard” vulnerability issue tracker integrated into ecosystem
  - For each “AVG-...” (Advisory Vulnerability Group) disclosure have a record with CVE entry, severity, status, type, remote yes/no, package. Only tracks public ones.
  - 878 advisories since its start in 2016
  - They can output as JSON
  - Works well for us. We’re all volunteers, we can’t stay on top of public formats.
    - MITRE publishes XML dump, have to go through to manually read it to see what’s changed (?)
    - Debian likes to split up packages, don’t know which packages are affected. Lack of metadata
    - Need more metadata that’s easier to parse, need easy to use API with all data in one place
  - How is this later used?
    - (1) Mailing lists & republish advisories
    - (2) tools that identify “what packages you use are obsolete/vulnerable” (but haven’t heard from them)
  - Currently not a CNA
  - We stay close to upstream, so there usually aren’t a number of issues to handle in Arch, other than pacman. Maybe 1/year
  - Severity: Look at others & then decide. Primarily Red Hat’s score, NVD
  - Version: Only identify single versions today, don’t have a use for ranges (don’t have multiple releases at the same time).
- Overview of the disclosure process in Red Hat CRob (@RedHatCRob)
  - CRob is product security engineer
  - They follow Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) - always respect finders’ wishes. Work with SuSE & Canonical, ask finders’ permission to share info with partners.
  - They helped write Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) report at FIRST
    - <https://www.first.org/global/sigs/vulnerability-coordination/multiparty/guidelines-v1.1>
  - Every proposed change is reviewed
  - How does Red Hat learn of vulnerabilities?
    - Try to have maintainers/contributors in important projects
    - May be on project security team
    - Distros list
    - Upstream monitoring
      - BlackHat, etc.
    - Reporter/finder approaches us
  - “We never knowingly publish silent fixes” - we believe users should be informed about risks. That’s a conversation with several upstreams
  - Defect trackers
    - Historically had been Bugzilla (public) - can mark security bugs as temporarily private
    - Public JIRA
    - GitHub/GitLab issues
  - All issues worked in private defect tracking systems until issue is public
  - Issue: NVD is slow. RH does its own analysis, creates its own CVSS score; if they’re different from NVD, raise issue
  - CVE page shows which package(s) are affected
  - Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) promoted by CERT/CC, they use it.
  - Generally a 10-15 year tail for support. Every trading house, bank, military, etc. They CANNOT deploy a new kernel. So need to work out how to create a relevant fix. Some upstreams have new ideas but often (nonstandard practices) are problematic; over time start to adopt general practices by others
  - Typical embargo time is 10-30 days
  - Fix ~1400 CVEs, about 15% are embargoed
  - There was a string where academic researchers said “biggest thing ever” & it was just availability stuff
  - I get a lot of commercial scanners (Qualys) - “I have 500 page” - but the version reported by RH includes backports yet has the same version# as upstream - they do add a tail to version number so it’s distinctive
  - Uses OVAL, publishes “these are vulnerabilities” & “these are fixed”
  - “Most people who use OSS are opposed to being tracked” (so it’s hard to get a lot of insight)
  - “My customer base is large organizations, heavily regulated. They’ll probably patch more regularly, but usually bursty.”
  - Some customers ask about vulnerabilities almost instantly & will rapidly update; some won’t ask until 5 years later
  - (On chat) CVSS has serious problems: <https://opensourcesecurity.io/2020/05/27/broken-vulnerability-severities/>
