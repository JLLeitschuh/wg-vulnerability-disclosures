## Notes

The list of metadata we believe should be included in a vulnerability disclosure (and the subset that we would like reports to contain) is now in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZpBk2aIup29KcWwN5MAhvkk60EE_DRt2YRtLo8P0zs/edit#gid=0).

## Appendix

### Am I actually vulnerable?: npm

1. Affected version(s)
   1. Is the version I use within the affected versions?
2. Impacted Methods/API calls. 2. Example: [https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/720](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/720) 3. The example mentions that the vulnerability is only for the `randomDigits().`If for example the library consumer uses only the `randomString()`, they know they are not affected.
3. (optional) specific language/platform versions that make this library vulnerable 4. Example: [https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:base64url:20180511](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:base64url:20180511) 5. The example mentions that the vulnerability exists only in Node &lt;=4
4. Reproduction steps/PoC code 6. Example: [https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/337](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/337) 7. Reproduction steps or PoC code helps the library consumer in their attempt to reproduce the vulnerability in their system.
5. npm - is it in the devDependencies section?
6. npm - does the vulnerability only work when [deployed in a server](https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/1242846979995996160) vs. client-side?
7. Could a CodeQL query be provided to tell you if you use the vulnerable code paths?
8. Is there a WAF (e.g. Mod Security) rule that can help block this attack till it‚Äôs remediated in the application?

### Am I actually vulnerable?: Google

Sources of reports:

- security@ email address
- Bug bounty program, vulnerability disclosure program
- Penetration test
- DAST or SAST tools like Qualys, Nessus, AWS Inspector, Rubocop
- Intrusion detection
- RSS feeds
- Vendor Advisories
- Email
- Package Vendors
- AWS Inspector
- Snyk
- Rennovate/Dependabot/etc

What are the steps/questions to ask?

- Triage
  - Is the vulnerability part of a library I have installed?
    - Is the integrity of the package maintained?
      - If yes, assume vulnerable
      - If no:
        - Does my code mitigate the vulnerability?
        - Does my code increase exploitability?
  - Is the vulnerability part of a system I am using?
    - If yes, assume vulnerable
  - Is the vulnerability part of code I have written?
    - Can I reproduce the vulnerability?
      - If yes, assume vulnerable
    - Is this a theoretical risk / best practice?
      - Is it exploitable?
        - If yes, assume vulnerable
        - If no, determine potential impact and make assumptions based on that
- Severity/Priority
  - What asset is this vulnerability in?
  - What is the severity based on the environment?
  - How do I use this package?
    - What parts do I actually connect to?
    - Is that part vulnerable?
  - Is this exploit in the wild?
- Mitigation
  - Is there a patch available?
  - Can I apply the patch quickly?
  - Can I mitigate the vulnerability another way?
- Incident Investigation
  - How long was I vulnerable? Was this exploited?
