<h4>Opens</h4>




* Seth Larson: Discussion on arbitrary code execution as a prerequisite for a vulnerability.
    * Noticing a trend in reports where the quality is low
        * I.e. magically run arbitrary run code before you can execute the actual attack
    * What could this group do to help mitigate this?
        * Resource to point to to help lower time spent on the defender/coder side
    * What does the group think?
        * Need to consider admin-like privs. So where does the line get drawn?
        * If there is no net gain in access, there is no vulnerability
        * They actively turn off the default security features
        * this sounds like a great idea for a discussion post type of conversation as opposed to a guide or blog (some of the other media methods we‚Äôve done) ü§î [https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/discussions](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/discussions)
        * With a different hat on, there may be something about this in new CVE assignment rules
        * If you turn on security can you still perform the attack?
    * ( ) Seth to open up an issue in the Vuln. repo
* Dick Brooks (REA) Presentation
    * Slides based upon the ‚Äúbuyer‚Äôs guide‚Äù
    * [https://github.com/rjb4standards/Presentations/raw/master/FDA%20Review-20231117.pptx](https://github.com/rjb4standards/Presentations/raw/master/FDA%20Review-20231117.pptx) 
    * NIST SBOM VDR - see NIST SP-800161, RA-5
        * [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf)
    * NIST‚Äôs inability to support VDR?
    * my [Art‚Äôs] notes on VDR [https://github.com/zmanion/SBOM/blob/main/VEX_VDR.md](https://github.com/zmanion/SBOM/blob/main/VEX_VDR.md)
        * Seth: advisories for humans, VEX for machines
    * We assume ‚Äúnot affected‚Äô, but they may also not have tested or be unaware of it, so an explicit vex document that says ‚Äúwe are not affected‚Äù confirms that assumption

Meeting Agenda



* Who wants to help out and scribe for us today?
* New Friends intros
    * Khahil White - Program Manager at LF/OSSF
* Opens
    * Becoming a CNA doc: reaching out to marketing, got final reviews now that travel has cooled down.
* Updates from Sub-Projects
    * Notes will be updated
* Still seeking co-lead and/or backlog warden to help with the group
    * Khahil raising hand here
* What to do with the ‚ÄúAutofix SIG‚Äù?
    * Anyone currently participating?
    * What do we want to do with this?
        * Maybe archiving this if not enough support
    * Guidelines seem useful and don‚Äôt want to lose the flow charts/diagrams/etc.
    * Spun off of the Alpha-Omega project
        * AO will not focus on the Omega tooling aspect in 2024
    * It‚Äôs all up to us now to keep this effort going
* VulnCon update!
    * **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Save the date - March 25-27, 2024 in RDU NC, USA</span>**
    * Program committee starts meeting ‚Ä¶ TODAY!  Look for CFP in November 
        * Help for choosing content, theme, and other aspects for the meeting
    * Panel to discuss how CVD works?
    * More details to come
    * [ ] CRob to send out the link to the mailing list
* Let‚Äôs keep working on the ‚ÄúRoadmap‚Äù part of our MVSR:

    **Proposed Roadmap:**

* Evangelize artifacts and tooling from the group through podcasts, conference presentations, blogs, etc. for things like the CVD guides, OSV, & VEX
    * Podcasts
    * Blogs
    * Conferences
    * Open office hours to interact with Open Source project managers and help them.
        * Support industry-wide vuln coordination efforts with good practices identified by the OSS-SIRT SIG
* Expand use of VEX by upstream projects through the advocacy and use of VEX and VEX-creation tools (such as OpenVEX).  Issuance of VEX documents upstream helps the whole ecosystem understand what is needed and how to effectively execute, providing critical vuln affectedness data to downstream consumers so they can understand how to incorporate with other vuln info (CSAF, OSV, SBOM, etc).
* increase awareness and use of CVD guides, techniques, and tools
* Increase the awareness and use of OSV
* Participate in forthcoming industry ‚ÄúVulnCon‚Äù and related conferences to share OSS vuln mgmt perspectives with broad PSIRT/CSIRT/CERT ecosystem

Meeting Agenda



* Who wants to help out and scribe for us today?
* New Friends intros
    * Toddy Mladenov (Microsoft)
    * Dana Wang (OpenSSF Architect)
    * Dick Brooks (Reliable Energy and Analytics (REA))
    * Jonathan - now independent
    * Tobias (Tobi) Heldt
    * Jared Miller (SAP)
* Opens
    * No opens
* Updates from Sub-Projects
    * No update
* Is anyone interested in co-leading this group?
    * No need to answer today
    * ( ) CRob to send out a formal request to the mailing list later today
    * Jonathan in a few months but not today
* Review MVSR for WG:

    **Proposed Mission:**


    The OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group seeks to help improve the overall security of the open source software ecosystem by helping develop and advocate well-managed vulnerability reporting and communication. We serve open source maintainers and developers, assist security researchers, and help downstream open source software consumers.

* ( ) CRob will make updates on github if any
* CISA has endorsed CSAF Security Advisories (profile 4) to report on affected software products from a new vulnerability. Will Security Advisories (CSAF profile 4) be addressed?
    * How overall artifacts fit in.
    * Talked about this over the years
    * CSAF is probably more appropriate for FIRST
    * We don‚Äôt have the authority the tell developers what to do but can advise
    * When to issue and advisory versus a VEX

    **Proposed Vision:**


    A world where coordinated vulnerability disclosure is a normal, easy, and expected process that is supported by guidance, automation, and tooling for maintainers, consumers, researchers, and vendors, with the goal of making open source software and the open source software supply chain more secure for everyone.


    A world where coordinated vulnerability disclosure is

* a common, easy, and expected process
* supported by well-documented guidance, automation, and tooling for open source maintainers and consumers, security researchers, and vendors
* with the goal of making open source software and supply chains more secure for everyone.
* Term coord vuln disc (CVD) coordinating around vendor timeline versus researcher timeline. Concerned about leaving vulns open for a long time.
    * Not necessarily supporting vendors but more of the open source community
    * Jonathan means vendors == open source maintainers
* End of last sentence awkward: Can replace the end with just ‚Äúmore secure‚Äù versus ‚Äúsafer place‚Äù?
* Supply chain encompasses SW from cradle to grave
    * Is supply chain defined somewhere to ensure we are talking about the same supply chain? The <xxx> SIG is working on this.
    * Thinking about SLSA it‚Äôs focus is on the factory piece
    * S2C2F - enterprise consumption
* Remove ‚Äúmature‚Äù from vendors?
    * Removed
* ‚ÄúAnd vendors‚Äù => for vendors
* ‚ÄúNormal and expected‚Äù: In the EU it‚Äôs required but making it easy
* Missed consumers
* Regulators? But we do have ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù at the end
    * Avoid being too exhaustive could potentially even remove ‚Äúvendors, ‚Ä¶‚Äù
    * Could be a good idea to add in Regulators
    * Policy-makers more appropriate - although drop this
* TODO: Specifically call out how policy makers, regulatory bodies etc can collaborate with us and be VERY clear be encourage them to leverage our work but our work is targeted at our primary users (vendors, researchers, maintainers)
* Process that‚Äôs supported by processes
    * Documentation instead?
    * Mechanisms?
    * Procedures?
    * Plus automation to support the vision

    **Proposed Strategy:**


    We plan on addressing this challenge through the following actions:

* Documenting and promoting reasonable vulnerability disclosure and coordination practices within the OSS ecosystem for component maintainers and community members by providing documented guidance and educational materials. \

* Identifying vulnerability disclosure pain points and incentives for OSS maintainer, consumers, and security researchers and taking steps to address them. \

* Facilitate the development and adoption of a standards-based OSS Vulnerability Exchange (VEX) that uses existing industry formats and allows OSS projects of all sizes to be able to report, share, and learn about vulnerabilities within OSS components.
* NOTES/FEEDBACK
    * Guidance - more broad
    * This is high-level and doesn‚Äôt have the specifics like the section below

    **Proposed Roadmap:**

* Evangelize artifacts and tooling from the group through podcasts, conference presentations, blogs, etc. for things like the CVD guides, OSV, OpenVEX, & autofix sig
    * Podcasts
    * Blogs
    * Conferences
    * Open office hours to interact with Open Source project managers and help them.
* Expand use of VEX by upstream projects through the advocacy and use of VEX and VEX-creation tools (such as OpenVEX).  Issuance of VEX documents upstream helps the whole ecosystem understand what is needed and how to effectively execute, providing critical vuln affectedness data to downstream consumers so they can understand how to incorporate with other vuln info (CSAF, OSV, SBOM, etc).
* increase awareness and use of CVD guides, techniques, and tools
* Increase the awareness and use of OSV
* Participate in forthcoming industry ‚ÄúVulnCon‚Äù to share OSS vuln mgmt perspectives with broad PSIRT/CSIRT/CERT ecosystem
* Support industry-wide vuln coordination efforts with good practices identified by the OSS-SIRT SIG
* Provide guidance, documentation, and templates to the OpenSSF for use as security policies and vulnerability management processes (security.md, vuln disclosure policy, etc.)
* Something something Autofix
    * [Omega MVSR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J9sanCA6ebdGpsUdE5a6If59hqj_5DJZV7XlBSZriu8/edit) -> assist with extracting our goals from
* NOTES/FEEDBACK
    * ( ) ALL work async and we can pick this topic up next time
    * We should be careful on promoting OpenVEX versus all of the other tools out there

<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>




* [https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/pull/139](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/pull/139)
    * Happy with the current state of the document and ready to move it somewhere stable
    * What‚Äôs next?
        * Determine where we put this, how we link to it on OpenSSF‚Äôs site, and if we need to publish a blog post or any media about it > Seth is going to follow up with OpenSSF directly
        * Future evolution? - if these records could be converted to a CVE and then converted to OSV then we could try and create a more singular source of truth
            * CNA in a box? Using a GitHub Action?
            * Goal is to make changes to vulnerability data in a single place (like OSV), and if you‚Äôre both an OSV and CVE data source, it‚Äôll update automatically in both places 
    * FYI: CVE-2023-42467 is one of the CVEs currently crashing
        * gsutil cp gs://osv-test-cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-39947.json /tmp
        * pipenv run python -m osv.analyze_tool --analyze_git=true --format=json /tmp/CVE-2023-39947.json
        *  
* Cloud Security Alliance is putting together a vulnerability data working group focused on data quality and all of the issues surrounding that
    * Had first meeting to discuss this Wednesday, Sept 27, and current plan is to follow up on Slack and determine scope for this effort and future meeting times and plans
    * Want to get vul DBs, scanners, and community members together to discuss these problems specifically

<h4>Opens</h4>




* OpenSSF EU - Cancel the meeting while the Open Source Summit is happening in Spain? September 20th for this WG
    * David, Jonathan in Spain
    * Madison not going and would be willing to run the meeting only if there will be people attending - currently only 2 people total
    * ( ) Action Jonathan - Ask attendance for this meeting in Slack or Email
* David A. Wheeler: FYI, the LF policy on vulnerability disclosures to LF projects is in its final stages. Basically it says ‚Äúreport vulnerabilities directly to the project/foundation‚Äù. It also cites OpenSSF works (including this group). It turns out that most OpenSSF projects already tell people how to report vulnerabilities; David created some PRs to increase that coverage. 
    * Work at the project directly and don‚Äôt work top down
    * ******** - this has been shared before with this group, just reminding everyone.
    * Wording is ready in word-press format, ready to be posted but going through LF Board for review

<h5>OSS-SIRT SIG - [Plan](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/tree/main/plan)</h5>




* On hold, pending funding approval

<h5>CVD Guide for Consumers - Issue [115](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/115) (Following along with our two existing CVD guides, what guidance can we share with open source consumers around OSS CVD, vuln mgmt, or resources they should get involved in on this topic?)</h5>




* Seeking contributors to work on [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aceGbHm_NQWCWRWnoELNLWL-S72CR79CaEA6mnYkyo0/edit#)

<h5>Autofix - Issue [123](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/123)</h5>




* 
    * Currently, opt-out is too heavy for developers and needs update but otherwise is this ready for TAC review
        * ( ) Action Jonathan - coordinate with CRob on getting this out
* 
    * Reviewing High Priority Goals
        * Privately vuln reports on github are per repo so goal of seeing the issue related to all repos
        * Anything else to add?
            * It would be nice to get some form of quantitative feedback on the overall process. Opt-out would capture this reason versus the process didn‚Äôt work - see Row 86
            * Bucket to capture general areas but also an open form for providing feedback
            * Need feedback during and after
            * Capture both public and private feedback throughout the process
    * Concern of this hitting hundreds or thousands of repos in the event there is big pushback or an issue with the process itself
        * Rollout suggestions starting with 10 repos then 20, etc. and fine tuning the process
        * Suggestion on making maintainers aware of this automated process so this isn‚Äôt a surprise
    * Jonathan would like to minimize burnout
        * E.g. not having to manually type change logs 100s of times, etc. In others words, minimize the pressure of this tool due to timelines and other pieces of this tool
    * [https://github.com/ossf/omega-moderne-client/tree/main/src/omega_moderne_client/campaign/campaigns](https://github.com/ossf/omega-moderne-client/tree/main/src/omega_moderne_client/campaign/campaigns) 
        * Messaging may need to change if this comes from a private PR
    * Another issue: can only specify disclosure report and ability to automate comments (Jonathan please check if this was captured correctly)
    * ( ) Action ALL - please review spreadsheet and provide any further comments
* 
    * Defines needed behaviors to complete this work
    * Currently working on disclosure related user stories
* 
    * Based upon this document
    * Goal - automate this policy

Meeting Agenda



* Who wants to help out and scribe for us today?
* New Friends intros
* Opens
* Updates from Sub-Projects
* ‚ÄúVulnCon‚Äù will be March 2024, APPROVED, Call for papers (CFP) will be forthcoming
* [WG Issue 36](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/136) - Work on WG [MVSR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p83YgnkT9YJLMQoppQx9KyMbRzYqO-ALb4TrmhTh1q0/edit#heading=h.h9d3nj3ybue3)
* David A. Wheeler: I‚Äôve developed a short page on vulnerability reporting to be put on the LF website soon. It basically says, ‚Äúreport vulnerabilities to the specific foundation/project‚Äù, so it‚Äôs not so much a ‚Äúnew policy‚Äù as ‚Äútelling people who to talk to‚Äù. I had to remove some things to get it to something that was acceptable to post. Any brief last-minute thoughts?: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNoaBj8qH4RUlBB9gH8r4hUso5O1aPORVW7I35HQbAk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNoaBj8qH4RUlBB9gH8r4hUso5O1aPORVW7I35HQbAk/edit)
    * I haven‚Äôt been able to get agreement on ‚ÄúSafe Harbor‚Äù or privacy text, and it‚Äôs been months. Let‚Äôs take the half-loaf, and we can try to add ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù & similar legal protections in a future version.
* David: When will the vulnerability disclosures WG merge the approved OpenSSF policy on [outgoing] vulnerability disclosures? [https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/149](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/149). I‚Äôd like to refer to it from the overall LF policy, but I have to have a URL for that :-).
    * It doesn‚Äôt have to be in this WG, I just thought that was the decision.
    * CRob & David will talk
    * David: Post-WG clarification, made AFTER the WG meeting because I realized the notes might be confusing: Just to be clear, <https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/149>  is only the *OUTGOING* vulnerability disclosure policy, which isn't what the LF-wide page is about. The Vulnerability disclosures WG has ALSO drafted an *INCOMING* vulnerability disclosure policy, that is, on how to report vulnerabilities to the OpenSSF (and how the OpenSSF should handle them). You can see the discussion & content of the INCOMING vulnerability disclosure policy here: <[https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/128](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/128)>. In fact, this LF-wide webpage is *based* on this work done by the Vulnerability Disclosures WG in issue 128, but with generalizations and dropping things we couldn‚Äôt get approved.

<h4>Meeting Agenda</h4>




* New Friends intros
* Visit the Lucid chart in development describing vulnerability disclosure workflow.
    * Jordan: The code generator may generate many fixes for non-statically typed language that require human intervention. The flow specified should only be used for cases where there is some assurance that the false positive rate is going to be very low. Jonathan added a new decision node to address this.

<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>




* [Disclosure Check](https://github.com/scovetta/disclosure-check) needs a home & maintainer!
    * Michael would love more contributors from OpenSSF for this project so there isn‚Äôt a single point of failure for maintenance
        * There may be room within the OpenSSF SIRT budget down the line to get paid development/support for this
    * Michael will make his repo public and Crob will send an email out to the working group asking for support!
    * The repo under OpenSSF was made public today > [https://github.com/ossf/disclosure-check](https://github.com/ossf/disclosure-check) 
* NVD worries
    * Unsure what the discussion was meant to be, so we can table it for now and discuss it at the next call
* [The Great Repository Audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EzYfM5-S5I27fC8_YE-bN-nm-J8Q1tG6aC_MKYpUvH0/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Proposal TL;DR > OpenSSF will perform these audits or give the projects the option to do it themselves and share the results, and includes:
        * Pentest of the firm < this would be publicly disclosed
        * Red team engagement against the organization < this would not be publicly disclosed
            * The methodology of exploitation will not be disclosed
    * Not yet included in the policy > want to include a bug bounty program to enable researchers to review this infrastructure at large after the audit is completed
    * Concerns?
        * How would we actually fund this? It‚Äôs $150,000 USD per artifact repository, macroeconomic constraints are **very** real
            * Current idea - Alpha Omega > [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) > OpenSSF
            * Desire to have one part time dedicated staff member (program manager) to run this
            * Depending on when we‚Äôd want to start, it could be included in a FY2024 budget (and may increase likelihood of receiving funding), but the group doesn‚Äôt have high confidence in this being funded sooner by the OpenSSF. Maybe there‚Äôs an opportunity to get funding elsewhere at first, and elsewhere down the line
        * Michael Scovetta & Crob are happy to help Jonathan work on funding proposals for this
    * Jonathan has involved folks from JFrog, Gradle, Chainguard, and Sonatype so far and they‚Äôve been in favor of the proposal
        * He hasn‚Äôt been able to connect with many folks that are running the security of the package registries. The OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories WG used to have participation from these types of folks but that‚Äôs lost momentum over time

    * Johnathan
        * Working on a proposal for an idea
            * The great repo audit
            * OpenSSF funded by Alpha-Omega will engage in pentesting the major artifact servers.
            * Usually when you buy software you‚Äôd look for a pentest report, etc.
            * Because major artifact servers don‚Äôt have similar agreements, they are run as ‚Äúpublic good‚Äù services, likely they haven‚Äôt been in scope for pentests before.
            * Dev publishes a package, uploaded, information rendered, anti-hajaking, potentially including the consuming infra (pip, verify=False???)
            * Would hire a pentest firm to do this.
            * Vuln disclosure policy would be applicable here
                * Some folks have said by the way introducing along with vuln disclosure policy sounds scary to pentesters
                * With a pentest report sometimes you‚Äôd have a bulk of disclosures. This would cause a slew of findings which could all end up in the same remediation timelines activated in parallel. This would be problematic from a response time perspective.
            * Would be good to ensure we have contacts and resources available to engage as findings come up.
            * Cloud leverage policy for critical and high vulns, exceptions for the others.
            * Would how we handle this project change based on who is managing the packaging registry/artifact server - a community run non-profit foundation vs. a corporate backing with more resources?
            * Official and verified package processes. In scope or out of scope?
                * Related?: SCITT: Use Case: Attestations of alignment to S2C2F and org Overlays
                    * Focus on promotion and transparency service to track promotion reasoning from 3rd party to 2nd party (verified) or 1st party (official)
* Notification mechanisms for new vulns (and VEX, and XYZ)
    * [Notifications of new VEX - https://github.com/openvex/spec/issues/9](https://github.com/openvex/spec/issues/9)
    * Please add thoughts on how we can get more folks upstream using SBOM and vuln exchange formats
    * We want to flush out how we can use them and connect each layer of the supply chain
    * 29th of May call will be a place to discuss more
    * [https://www.wired.com/2012/10/joe-postel/](https://www.wired.com/2012/10/joe-postel/)
    * NVD only has CVE- IDs, from CNAs

        * DDoS release trains by vuln issuance? (similar to pentesting artifact servers)
    * Dave Dugal ([CVSS SIG](https://www.first.org/cvss/) chair) to come present in our WG about changes in the CVSS 4.0 schema - [https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/](https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/), [https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2023/update-on-cvss-4-0/jan-25-2023-ssca-dugal-rich.pdf](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2023/update-on-cvss-4-0/jan-25-2023-ssca-dugal-rich.pdf)

<h4>Meeting Agenda</h4>

* Opens
* Updates from Sub-Projects

<h4>Opens/Meeting Notes</h4>




* Jonathan submitted a talk to DEFCON to present his vulnerability policy
* Outgoing Vulnerability Disclosure Policy ratified by TAC
    * Next step: start a TAC level issue to determine where the policy should live
    * One issue: Google isn‚Äôt good at indexing GitHub pages
    * A GitHub Page/website (WordPress) could also be a way to share the policy (or any static document), but changes to it are a ‚Äúcode change‚Äù essentially
        * Does Google index GitHub pages well? Does GitHub encourage this indexing?
    * Overall desire to move to more version control for working group docs that isn‚Äôt Google Drive?
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/122#issuecomment-1537841084](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/122#issuecomment-1537841084) 
* Quick review of what this WG is doing/threads/docs/topics? This might just be the Sub-Projects list. Also open GitHub issues.
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues)
* Safe Harbor discussion (it was removed from the vulnerability policy) > LF legal wanted to remove the original safe harbor text that was drafted
    * Nicole: we can do a quick comparison of popular safe harbor policies (disclose.io, BugCrowd, etc.) to determine common elements and what we want to ensure is included in ours
        * David: That would be great! Please do! If there‚Äôs a general safe harbor policy that‚Äôs reusable already, let us know that too.
        * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/128#issuecomment-1537836137](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/128#issuecomment-1537836137) 
    * How does this look to the LF if we force projects that may not be mature enough or have the capacity to respond to vulnerability reports? Legal isn‚Äôt currently concerned
        * Are we / they (other projects, legal) ok with the fact some thing are / will be won‚Äôt fix - red herring it sounds like
        * David: Every OSS project should expect to receive bug reports, it‚Äôs hard to imagine what they expect otherwise.
        * Francis: The scope on the policy could help project maintainers here > we could focus on integration or deployment at the project level, and if it‚Äôs broader than that then recommend the reporter go upstream

<h5>OSS-SIRT SIG - [Plan](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/tree/main/plan)</h5>




* Presentation to GB being prepared; plan still under review

<h5>CVD Guide for Consumers - Issue [115](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/115)</h5>




* Seeking contributors to work on [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aceGbHm_NQWCWRWnoELNLWL-S72CR79CaEA6mnYkyo0/edit#)

<h5>CVE Autofix - Issue [123](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/123)</h5>




* [Proposal: Open Source Security Foundation Outbound Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2Xfw9i5pSA-0XbIw3a4kcW2o4PByxDbjcnWe9mlQwA/edit#)
* Review of outstanding comments on the doc:
    * Current version text around disclosing zero days: ‚ÄúThe Publication Date for a 0-day will be accelerated, typically** at most** 7 days of the Notice Date.‚Äù
    * Suggested change: ‚ÄúThe Publication Date for a 0-day will be accelerated, typically to **within** 7 days of the Notice Date.‚Äù
    * Discussion:
        * Jonathan: 7 day maximum is intentional and there is a clause in the doc to give the ability for changing the timeline. There‚Äôs also a clause to make exceptions to the timeline for extreme circumstances, and the expectation is that if a fix can‚Äôt be supplied in 7 days, then mitigations would be provided for end users.
        * David & Crob: in favor of adding the flexibility that the change proposes. The impact of the vulnerability may impact the timeline, so changing it to ‚Äúwithin‚Äù allows for that. ‚ÄúAt most‚Äù or ‚Äúalways‚Äù are too strong of terms to use because it may not apply appropriately more generally.
* We should keep reviewing what other code hosting services offer besides GitHub‚Äôs private vulnerability reporting that allow for submitting fixes using automation to ensure that they fit the process workflow. At least look at GitLab. See:
    * [https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/confidential.html](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/confidential.html)

OpenVEX SIG



* Adopted as SIG under WG.  Waiting on Legal review/ip transfer.
* Working on git repo and establishing regular calls

OSV Project

Meeting Notes:



* OpenSSF Inbound Security policy (Luigi proposed)
* David A. Wheeler: I‚Äôm trying to gen up an LF-wide security policy telling researchers (finders) how to report vulnerabilities.
    * My expectation is that it‚Äôll basically say, ‚Äúfollow the policy of the relevant foundation/project. For LF infrastructure & website, email [security@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:security@linuxfoundation.org)‚Äù.
    * So yes, OpenSSF will still need their own. But it will help researchers find it.
    * Once I get more eyes on it, want to share it with this group.
    * Trying to work out a legal ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù text - hard, some attackers try to pretend to be legitimate researchers.
    * Would like to create a generic text, at least for the safe harbor, so others can reuse. Don‚Äôt have one yet, if you have suggestions, please let me know.

<h4>Meeting Agenda</h4>




* Who wants to help out and scribe for us today?
* New Friends intros
* Opens
* Updates from Sub-Projects
* David A. Wheeler: Possible idea - LF-wide [policy] text to encourage vulnerability reporting. Current draft text, what do you think?
    * If you find a security vulnerability in the software developed by an LF foundation or project, please report the vulnerability directly to that foundation or project, using their vulnerability reporting process and policy. Examples of such processes/policies are those of FINOS, the Linux kernel, Kubenetes, Zephyr, and Yocto. Feel free to browse our list of foundations/projects.
    * If a specific LF project doesn‚Äôt state how to report a vulnerability, report the vulnerability to the foundation that runs the project using its process. Also, if an LF project or foundation doesn‚Äôt make it clear how to report vulnerabilities, please ask them to define their process and make it clear, so that you can then report the vulnerability. If a project doesn‚Äôt respond in any way to a report, after some time (by default 21 days) retransmit it several times in case it was dropped, and give them time to fix it before making the vulnerability public (by default 90 days from the initial report). If the project/foundation is marked as no longer being maintained (e.g., it is ‚Äúarchived‚Äù or ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù), then reporters may directly report the vulnerability to the public, but they must also clearly note that the project is already marked as being no longer maintained.
    * If you _maintain_ an LF project, or lead an LF foundation, we ask that you take steps to (1) make it _easy_ for vulnerability finders (security researchers) to report vulnerabilities, and (2) be ready to receive those reports. The OpenSSF ‚Äú[Guide to implementing a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process for open source projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md#readme)‚Äù can help you do that. As noted above, typically vulnerability reports are sent to security@YOUR_DOMAIN and/or GitHub private reporting; this should be noted in a SECURITY.md file and README file. We also encourage you to make vulnerabilities less likely. For example, we encourage you to [learn how to develop secure software](https://openssf.org/training/courses/), as well as use practices (see[ OpenSSF Security Scorecards](https://securityscorecards.dev/) and the [OpenSSF Best Practices badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/)). Each LF foundation and project is expected to try to develop software that is adequately secure for its purpose and to apply good practices to counter attacks (including supply chain attacks), and continuously improve.
    * Older plan was ‚Äú[security@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:security@linuxfoundation.org)‚Äù would be the reporting location of last resort for LF foundations/projects. But that might delay reporting & creates work at the wrong place, so instead, will use that only for LF infrastructure & website, otherwise just send to project/foundation
    * Lazy consensus: Think it‚Äôs a good idea?
    * Need to sort who will handle [security@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:security@linuxfoundation.org) (multiple people) - that has already been done, it‚Äôs LF IT.
    * We‚Äôd love to have specific traces from a vulnerability to specific code changes
        * David: That‚Äôs not something many will agree with, and in fact, many will specifically oppose. It‚Äôs more important to get a report & fix it; traceability is nice, but do *not* plan to require it as that will mean we can‚Äôt get it out the door.
    * We‚Äôd love to have details about a vulnerability fixed included as part of a release
        * David: I agree, but I don‚Äôt think we can get that agreement LF-wide. Let‚Äôs work on what we CAN get agreement on now, and possibly add that in the future once we can gain such agreement. We might be able to add that long-term. Again, the current focus is to get the information & fix the vulnerability in a new release
    * Concern: Is there a central repository of LF-owned domains?
        * Not that I know of.
        * We could ask LF IT to create & maintain that list (e.g., on linuxfoundation.org)
    * Want to offer a safe harbor.
        * CRob: I know Amit, she has a lot of experience on safe harbor text. Amit‚Äôs a lawyer.
        * Jonathan: I have Gradle‚Äôs text.
        * From a legal risk perspective, the easiest thing to do is nothing. The next best is reporting anonymously. Don‚Äôt force ‚Äúmust follow this process exactly or safe harbor doesn‚Äôt apply‚Äù - [Jonathan Leitschuh](mailto:jleitschuh@linuxfoundation.org)will work with legal to try to do that.
        * Will also need to ‚Äúget the word out‚Äù to LF projects.
    * SIRT could in theory do the routing.
    * If possible, it‚Äôd be good if the project could say ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what we fixed‚Äù in its release
    * No one opposes!
* Luigi Gubello: review and approve the [OpenSSF Inbound Security Policy](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/128), in time for the LF Vulnerability Reporting process. In particular:
    * Approve the In-Scope list
    * Create the security contact [security@openssf.org](mailto:security@openssf.org) and give access to some people (WG vulnerability-disclosures and Alpha/Omega team might be two good candidates) - currently [security@openssf.org](mailto:security@openssf.org) goes to operations.
    * [Scovetta] It would be nice to adopt Security Insights across OpenSSF projects (and advocate for it broadly) since it includes programmatically readable reporting mechanisms.
    * We could permit PGP in the future, but definitely don‚Äôt require it & is not a blocker.
    * Most people will not use PGP, it‚Äôs too hard. If the goal is to encrypt emails, hop-by-hop encryption is easy to use, automatic (STARTTLS & MTA-STS) and more than sufficient. GitHub private reporting also works.
* Jonathan Leitschuh: Review feedback from LF Legal on [Proposal: Open Source Security Foundation Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2Xfw9i5pSA-0XbIw3a4kcW2o4PByxDbjcnWe9mlQwA/edit#heading=h.k6iyp023mfls)
    * The word ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù has some specific expectations
    * Maybe a partner document with the policy that includes procedure & notes.
    * Jonathan L. will go through. He will probably have another meeting next Wednesday same time to make a final pass of this document. LF Legal will need to review it.
* Michael Scovetta: PoC tool to detect disclosure mechanisms for a given open source project. Parses metadata, readme/security.md, Github PVR, Tidelift, etc. and tries to make it easier. Happy to donate to OpenSSF. Should be `pip install disclosurecheck` or similar by next week. [https://github.com/scovetta/disclosure-check](https://github.com/scovetta/disclosure-check). Feel free top open issues in the repo for now.

<h4>Meeting Agenda</h4>




* New Friends intros
    * Jordan Harband - OpenSSF
    * Andres Orbe - NJIT
    * Aavash Chhetri
* Who wants to help out and scribe for us today?
    * Josh & Yesenia
* Opens
    * None today
* Discussions:
    * High level overview of the group
        * Addressing vulnerabilities at scale (e.g. 65,000 packages in a single campaign) while doing that in a way that is respectful of package maintainers.
    * [Specification: OpenSSF Compliant Automated Vulnerability Fix Campaign](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QwN7yQXWGM2tJaostIRNqyZIhVceVlIyXqCrSdC4E8/edit#)
        * Set of standards, that if followed, allows vuln campaign authors to leverage the OpenSSF name.
        * Jordan: Approach currently being taken is slightly different than how they would approach it.
            * Split the automated patching to ensure positive maintainer relationship + highest impact
            * ‚ÄúWarm fuzzies of open source security‚Äù
            * Private vulnerability reporting (PVR) - two general groups, those who have PVR enabled, and those who are unaware of PVR.
                * Also some folks who would enable PVR on a project, but don‚Äôt have the permissions to do so.
            * Best practice in the interim has been having security reporting (e.g. SECURITY.md with contact information)
            * Feels that we should follow the security reporting guidelines/policy even if it hinders automation efforts
            * How do we balance not overburdening the maintainers and enabling large scale vuln fix campaigns
            * Ideal solution would be PVR being opt-out rather than opt-in
            * Notify ‚Äúgroup‚Äù in one location, not multiple notification for the same ‚Äúgroup‚Äù (organization/etc)
            * Currently there isn‚Äôt a good mechanism to know if PVR is enabled at the repo or org level.
            * ‚ÄúPlease enable PVR‚Äù is the biggest concern
                * If there isn‚Äôt a security policy, less obnoxious from the maintainer perspective. But, if there _is_ a policy in place for how to report, it can be very irritating to get ‚ÄúPlease enable PVR‚Äù issues for each repo.
        * Josh
            * Repo host - enabled by default and more integrated feature (dependent on the SCM tool)
        * Jonathan: Org level SECURITY.md worth distinguishing from repo SECURITY.md?
            * Apache foundation, Eclipse, others that are unknown can trip up this logic - can be under one GitHub org but ran by multiple groups
            * Matt: Yes, in fact there was an OpenSSF specific security file:
                * [Open Source Security Foundation Security Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9lVEPiufRWkIT060mS5YuNXDSh4pVhizy3VKdbl9UU/edit)
                * This was being looked at to include positive pointers to specific files and proof for metrics/scorecard checks towards badging
        * PVR is dependent on the platform support
            * Workaround where unavailable: Notify of a vulnerability but don‚Äôt include specific details. Request enabling PVR as a part of the notification
            * Can‚Äôt be proscriptive without more context and experience with how these campaigns are received in practice
            * SECURITY.md is an example of maintainers providing preferred method of communication

    * See: [https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/pull/47](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/pull/47) 
    * Group agreed to accept the change
* David A. Wheeler: Possible idea - LF-wide [policy] text to encourage vulnerability reporting. Current draft text, what do you think?
    * If you _maintain_ an LF project, or lead an LF foundation, we ask that you take steps to (1) make it _easy_ for vulnerability finders (security researchers) to report vulnerabilities, and (2) be ready to receive those reports. The OpenSSF ‚Äú[Guide to implementing a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process for open source projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md#readme)‚Äù can help you do that. As noted above, typically vulnerability reports are sent to security@YOUR_DOMAIN and/or GitHub private reporting; this should be noted in a SECURITY.md file and README file. We also encourage you to make vulnerabilities less likely. For example, we encourage you to [learn how to develop secure software](https://openssf.org/training/courses/), as well as use practices (see[ OpenSSF Security Scorecards](https://securityscorecards.dev/) and the [OpenSSF Best Practices badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/)). Each LF foundation and project is expected to try to develop software that is adequately secure for its purpose and to apply good practices to counter attacks (including supply chain attacks), and continuously improve.
    * Current plan is ‚Äú[security@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:security@linuxfoundation.org)‚Äù would be the reporting location of last resort for LF foundations/projects.
    * Lazy consensus: Think it‚Äôs a good idea!
    * Need to sort who will handle [security@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:security@linuxfoundation.org) (multiple people)

    * Please title it [google document] vulnerability disclosure as it is not covering everything related to security so the title and contents match [not the security file itself]
    * There is a template already in our guide for maintainers we should leverage
    * There are one or two other disclosure policy discussions ongoing - including one on outgoing reports - and possibly already an inbound
    * This is the same one
    * This would be a model (template) for everyone who wants to adopt it
    * Everyone should look at this file and provide feedback, ideally by next call, as we can then ask it to be part of the default collateral when making new projects within the foundation.
* David A. Wheeler: GitHub private reporting - add that?
    * See: [https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/pull/47](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/pull/47) 
    * They have announced a formal beta for a private reporting capability which makes it much easier to accept vulnerability reports
    * This is time sensitive as there are other items in process that would refer to this
    * Is everyone ok with recommending (not requiring) this?
        * Approved by the group
* David A. Wheeler: Possible idea - LF-wide [policy] text to encourage vulnerability reporting. Current draft text, what do you think?
    * If you _maintain_ an LF project, or lead an LF foundation, we ask that you take steps to (1) make it _easy_ for vulnerability finders (security researchers) to report vulnerabilities, and (2) be ready to receive those reports. The OpenSSF ‚Äú[Guide to implementing a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process for open source projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md#readme)‚Äù can help you do that. As noted above, typically vulnerability reports are sent to security@YOUR_DOMAIN and/or GitHub private reporting; this should be noted in a SECURITY.md file and README file. We also encourage you to make vulnerabilities less likely. For example, we encourage you to [learn how to develop secure software](https://openssf.org/training/courses/), as well as use practices (see[ OpenSSF Security Scorecards](https://securityscorecards.dev/) and the [OpenSSF Best Practices badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/)). Each LF foundation and project is expected to try to develop software that is adequately secure for its purpose and to apply good practices to counter attacks (including supply chain attacks), and continuously improve.
    * Summary [TL;DR]? The LF as a backstop last resort if i can‚Äôt find a specific owner, i can use security @ as a backstop for reporting issue with LF projects.
        * Art Manion has been looking at something like this and wants to make sure there is not a conflict / it is at the right level
    * TBD based on funding where the destination for the mailbox would be/go
    * We expect this to end up catching infrastructure level reports as there is not currently a good location for these today [reports today on DNS for example]
        * The email address already exists
        * The discussion needs to occur on what group/people will monitor this as >1 person is needed
    * Ideally the LF would have a better way to find/contact projects
    * The group is fine with it
* Jonathan Leitschuh - the document discussed last meeting has been submitted and we are awaiting feedback on it
* Jonathan Leitschuh - API for vulnerability (private) reports is coming to allow opening reports in the API in the next few weeks
    * Pi? GitHub PR out to add bindings to the api [https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/pull/2483](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/pull/2483)

* WG held a vote. It was exciting. Majority elected endorse OpenVEX joining the Vuln Disclosure WG. Doodle poll closing in 48 hours to schedule recurring meeting for this topic.
* CRob already involved with CISA‚Äôs VEX/SBOM efforts
* OpenVEX toolset as an added option
* Planning on working with OASIS, CSAF, CycloneDX to build consensus
* Jonathan has a doc out for review on disclosure policy. Waiting for TAC review, not sure how to get it on their radar. Add to doc for future meeting items. (Short items only?) Email the TAC list with pre-read.
* Update on autofix
    * meetings still occuring Wed 4pm Eastern

<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>




* Starting with new friends
    * Nicole Schwartz is back after swapping companies
    * Luigi - usually in another group but has been posting a bunch so here
    * Namita - has been in best practices but new to this group
* Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Jonathan
    * I want to be able to submit this to legal and TAC?
    * Want to review open comments and concerns and resolve them
    * Issue with deadline - 
        * CRob 90 days may not be enough time what happens if it goes beyond
        * +1 certain actors are using the 90 days to their favor when it may not be enough
        * It‚Äôs intended to be slightly flexible, but you need a timeline ref: project 0 FAQ if you don‚Äôt have one and don‚Äôt enforce it vendors continue to move forward with not fixing things in a timely manner
        * Crob your targeting OSS maintainers as they are not a company and not beholden to dates
        * Replace == time limit
    * Request to be non us centric with calling out working days and holidays - substitution to major public holidays as that can be negatively taken by international maintainers
        * Noting it is important to strike a balance between being palatable (flexible) while still being able to set expectations
    * Define ‚Äúextreme circumstances‚Äù
        * Perhaps set example instead of define?
        * Earthquake?
        * Add additional examples as desired
    * Patch is schedule = Remediation
        * What if it is easier to do a configuration file change and a proper fix at a later date
        * We are setting the outer bounds, if a maintainer wants to accelerate that they can
        * But not everything is fixed by patch they could instead turn off a service
        * Remediation is more readily understood by non developer users
        * Remediation is a better catch all, where mitigation and things can have specific things people think of
        * Calling out the verbiage as we may want to be aware remediation steps may begin, or start within the time limit, of 14 days
            * Remediation steps should be the maintainers - it could include starting with a hot fix (band aid)
            * Sometimes the remediation is not able to be completed within a timeframe the security researcher wants - the ultimate fix may vary - there could be regressions.
            * We are trying to get this to be flexible?
            * Yes but if there is a complex ecosystem or maintainer can‚Äôt reach timeline we need to be able to negotiate and avoid boxing ourselves in and help downstream manage risk
    * 21 day mitigation paragraph
        * If we have direct confirmation the report has been received, but not acknowledged
            * 
        * Only disclose at 21 days if the report has been received
            * But not getting acknowledgement of receipt - using ghosting as avoidance or it could be them not being there
            * Dependencies that are popular are maintained by one person who may be on vacation
            * In europe it is common that people go on vacation for 4-5 weeks and don‚Äôt touch their phone. 5 weeks we can get creative with alternative ways to reach the maintainer.
            * Is there a - who do we contact? Is there a standard way? 
                * That is in another document, a researcher guide of where to look to find ways to report a vulnerability
                * LINK: [https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/finder-guide.md](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/finder-guide.md) 
        * Q: will open ssf release a patch
            * Not a hard requirement
        * Statement about ‚Äú7 days is appropriate‚Äù
            * Request to table for a week
                * Jonathan to schedule a meeting
            * Back on topic - attempt to avoid a specific amount of days to lock in
                * Could need to be faster? Yes
                * There could be legal terminology needs/concerns 
                * Emergency scenarios like embargo leaks
                * Warning could be pedantic and literal interpretations of terminology to avoid a specific number people obsess over
                * Most people will address within the timeline but we like to reserve this
                * I want to be able to put things up front they can look at and avoid surprises and not we‚Äôre making it up on the fly - we‚Äôre applying this uniformly to all maintainers
                * Many people don't‚Äô read and just skim looking for numbers
                * +1 ^ & widespread adoption needs to be flexible, as time progresses we can add more structure - getting people to understand what we are trying to do, more people will be willing to work with you instead of identifying edge cases which can derail the conversation
                * Active exploitation is rare, if it‚Äôs a one person project, tends to happen in larger projects like struts, we are unlikely to be placing this on these smaller maintainers
*  OPEN VEX
    * 11 members voted in favor of adoption, 5 against, many abstentions
    * This is now a member project
    * TAC needs to formally vote and go on legal review of IP and have it transferred to the foundation
    * Any additional feedback or comments

    * Thank you for everyone who participated and gave your time and attention we had a lot of good feedback to consider as we move forward
* Security Policy - hold for next meeting & can discuss on slack (there is a conversation started there)
    * I am working on format to share security information about a project. Some of our platform did not have a security.md or a way to contact maintainers. I propose we have one that covers all of ours as a default and individual maintainers can have their own if desired. A generic email and using github private to report. Needs to be easy to read - how to report - how we communicate. I don‚Äôt think we need lots of details and add complexity. I have based it on the wrapper you suggested and then added a bit more context especially the main change is we use private issues primarily and email as secondary. It is not perfect. We can adapt and improve based on incoming reports. Some more popular projects may get more than others and we are likely to get a number of false positives to start. Grammar edits welcome.
    * Consistent across foundation projects - since we recommend it
    * There is now a valid email in that document because a vuln had to be reported
        * Many thumbs up
    * Next step: formally log in the issue tracker and keep it on the docket in order to get implemented
    * Please review the document and provide comments quickly
* What is the process to move forward something to the TAC
    * Create an issue and submit to TAC - next meeting is results of tac election so likely would not have time - don‚Äôt wait get issue created and submitted (email) so it‚Äôs in the queue

<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>




* 3. Messaging and 4. Opt-out
* GitHub private PR
* Normal flow is to ask maintainer to open a GHSA to allow the private communication
* New feature for security researchers to disclose the vulnerability privately, but it is an opt-in feature
* GHSA does not have a public API, limited to UI, can‚Äôt scale it up with tooling
    * API is coming soon, maybe in next 2-3 weeks
* Opt-out mechanisms
    * .github/GH-ROBOTS.txt and others
* Granularity
    * Global disable?
    * Per submitter
    * Per repository
    * Per branch to only receive PRs for maintained branches for supported versions of products
* There can be a GSD id regardless of the package maintainer opting out
    * There can still be a diff
* It may get messy if PRs are made against many branches
* Default to PR against main branch
* Enabling private PR by default is related to one of the biggest complaints by package maintainers that the PR can expose the presences of a vulnerability
* 2. Mandatory Private Disclosure
    * Private disclosure to top 10000 critical projects
        * There are challenges about private disclosures at scale for projects that opt out of private disclosures
    * Do we build the doc around what is currently supported, then modify it once new features come out?
        * For near term features that will land before document is finalized, keep updating doc, for long-term problems, move to another section or future facing version of the doc
    * Currently, no platform supports private disclosures via API
    * There is no standardized channel to disclose manually
    * The maintenance of the list, top 10 on the list have manual update challenges, tabled until next meeting.
* Centralized page for campaign
    * Not clear if information cannot all be contained in PR
    * Will follow up to understand details of requirements better
* Add information about 3rd party review of code generator
    * To add confidence that the campaign
* Not having sponsorship
    * Open up to broader group for discussion

* Updates from Sub-Projects
    * .
* [CRob] Upcoming TAC elections:
    * **Voter Eligibility (Electorate) Self-Nomination Process**
        * Any contributor to OpenSSF working groups or initiatives is eligible to participate in the election. Valid contributions include: commits or submitted pull requests via Github; public edits or comments on Google docs or other work products associated with OpenSSF; posting messages to any mailing list or on Slack; and beyond that any other form of positive engagement with OpenSSF activities. The form asks you for an example of your contributions; this is merely to make it easier for election observers and OpenSSF staff to validate. If you have in any way been involved in or care about OpenSSF, but are in doubt as to whether your contribution ‚Äúcounts‚Äù, please fill it out anyways, and we will follow up.
        * Deadline: March 12, 2023
        * [Voter Eligibility Self-Nomination Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgQdwnRH5nMLkYUDhuM7LYxUynairprGc_xAPIZm9SGaytfg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
    * **TAC Self-Nomination Process**
        * The OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is composed of seven total individuals, four of whom are elected annually. If you are interested in serving on the TAC, and qualify as an eligible voter as above, please complete the self-nomination form below,

    * **SCIR Self-Nomination Information and Process**
        * [Since early in its existence](https://openssf.org/blog/2020/10/07/openssf-seeks-security-community-individual-representative-for-governing-board/), the OpenSSF Governing Board has sought to ensure it gets adequate input from voices in the software security community who would otherwise not be at the table. We seek candidates for the Security Community Individual Representative (SCIR) who can represent those voices, while also being a subject matter expert in the field with their own set of perspectives. Familiarity with the different OpenSSF working groups and projects, and being able to dedicate the time to be sufficiently informed on the issues that arise in our monthly calls and ongoing discussions, is highly desired. It is also highly desired, but not required, that the SCIR be a contributor and thus eligible to vote in the election. 
        * Deadline: March 12, 2022

* Seeking a WG **_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Backlog Warden</span>_** to help us organize & prioritize our work streams
    * Work estimate: 1h/month, lightweight
    * Tasks:
        * Review Issues & PRs
        * Bring items to WG that need attention
        * Help clean out cruft & keep us moving forward!
    * Earn amazing accolades from your peers and oss-friends!
        * All: y-ay.
    * How? ‚Üí ping CRob on slack
* APAC call update - on 23Feb met with two gents from the OSV project.  Good convo.  Seeking ways we can all better collaborate together.
    * TZ challenges; most of OSV is in Australia.
    * Zoom chat: once a month planned - next call last week of March,.. See the calendar.
        * todo(CRob): add the entry in the shared calendar.
* OpenVEX with the Dans!!
    * DL: ZOOM security update, brb.
    * See presentation at minute 14 (until min 44) of the meeting recording.
    * OSV blog post recently published about Automating and Scaling Vex Generation: [https://osv.dev/blog/posts/automating-and-scaling-vex-generation/](https://osv.dev/blog/posts/automating-and-scaling-vex-generation/) 
    * Questions phase:
        * Jeffrey Borek: some outreach has been done with vendors on this. What is the situation w.r.t. Working across boundaries and groups on these standards? Does this risk getting the industry more confused / fragmented? Clients/Customers tend to be overwhelmed by a new tech/approach every 4 weeks, is this yet another thing we are adding on the OpenSSF agenda, or is this something we are early enough in the intro process here to have some sort of alignment?
            * DL: ISO?IETF? - yes - my understanding is that the CISA working group was to define an understanding, not the format. Yes we would like this to be proposed as an international standard. Waiting on general consensus .
            * Art Manion: correct, the CISA work will publish a document ‚Äúany day now‚Äù on the requirements, not a prescriptive list of items or implementations.
            * JB: thank you, it helps, but it won‚Äôt solve the customer problem‚Ä¶
            * DL: correct, we understand that‚Ä¶ we do think VEX + SBOM will be important for customers though. They will lead to cost, and confusion‚Ä¶ hopefully scanners can obfuscate this away.
        * Jay White: Regarding pushing this as a standard, starting here in the OpenSSF is a good place to start that process. The OpenSSF is a good group to start that collaboration and contribution.
            * DL: yes, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd like to do.
            * CRob: what would you like for us to assist with?
            * DL:  We‚Äôd like the OpenVEX to be added to this WG
                * Follow the intro process
                * Be adopted, become a standard.
            * CRob: arright! We‚Äôll start the process and create an issue to discuss this on GH.
            * FP: timeline for adoption?
                * Whenever.
            * CRob: excellent - we‚Äôll set this up.
* Vulnerability disclosure

<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>




* Intros, new friends all get to know a bit about each other
* Purpose - to discuss best practices about how to automate the disclosure of vulns within oss (and not upset the maintainers too much)
* Desire to minimize the likelihood of making maintainers upset and getting banned by environments like GitHub, bitbucket. Gitlab
* Is drawing up a list of requirements for campaigns: 
    * [Specification: OpenSSF Compliant Automated Vulnerability Fix Campaign](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QwN7yQXWGM2tJaostIRNqyZIhVceVlIyXqCrSdC4E8/edit?usp=sharing)
    * JL is seeking feedback from this crew (please note who is logging feedback [log into google please) (outline to follow)
        * High level - any vuln that is fixed at scale should be fixed upstream
        * Mandatory private disclosure timeframe
        * Messaging requirements of data that must be included in PR
        * Origin requirements (must come a from a real person, not a robot)
        * Suggestions around targeting certain source code 
        * Commit msg format specs
        * Host coordination
        * Offering disclosure assistance to maintainer if they desire
    * Does anyone see anything initially glaringly missing or wrong? (understanding this is the first look at the doc)
        * Kasimir notes: commit msg format, gpg signing
        * Munawar questions: has been manually doing this; doing this at a small level is hard.  Is there another way they could do some of these things?  How do you automate private vuln reports?  Doing 20 projects seems like A LOT. JL - it has been best effort.  There is a [guide ](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/finder-guide.md)for reporters from OSSF that can provide some insights to researchers  JL - has been signing things himself, but since work is shifting to the A-O project there are some complications with LF legal to work through around signing.  JL & OSSF is working through ways to do.  
        * CJM - could you grant explicit terms along with PR for CLAs that have been approved in the past? JL - the maintainers typically are not lawyers and may not have access to lawyers for this.  JL - what is the upper level of CLAs MH has signed (10-15 on good days, 5-7 normally)  MH says his company is shifting to person-owned acct as opposed to an org one to reduce friction with devs.  JL - wondering on how to address ‚Äúthe bus factor‚Äù...would existing prs need ot be regen‚Äôed, would having dupe prs be a big challenge?  MH - pr‚Äôs have a lifecycle 
        * JL - A-O is developing a portal to aggregate output of scanners/tools to have a ‚Äúsingle pane of glass‚Äù
        * JL - will be sharing doc through vuln-disc wg mailing list & Slack channel after making github issue in wg [repo](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues)
        * researcher s mostly have been working with github for these issues.
        * Is anyone engaged in this work in an active campaign they‚Äôd be interested in discussing?
            * MH - interested in SQL injection. 
                * JL has some early code, but has not recently worked on it
                * JL is interested in data flow/control flow analysis.  CodeQL does this currently.  Implementation will be difficult.  Glad to share as able to work on further
            * JL - there is a proposal to fix the cve-2007-4559 vuln that Kasimir may be interested to look at
            * JL - campaigns have been historically one-offs.  Is anyone running regular campaigns or one-offs?  MH - has been on a rolling basis; as new reports come in that may invalidate earlier ones they update their analysis and effort starts again.  Not really structures.  There are too many bugs to effectively handle
                * JL - are these shared via PRs (yes, sometimes dev asks for an issue, not a PR)
                * KS - same.  One-offs
            * JL has plans for several automatic campaigns that will be put into place
    * After doc is reviewed by this group, JL would like to get feedback from maintainers (apache commons perhaps as one group)
        * MS - is there potential for different groups using different tooling?  If folks follow the spec, how will campaigns be coordinated to ensure devs aren‚Äôt flooded?  JL- hopes this group can help coordinate that  MS - perhaps researchers should register their campaigns to minimize the reports at once  MH - would need a central place the data would come into for folks to understand overlap is occurring.
        * MH - another question - because we are bulk generating things, it is hard to track the status of the pull requests.  Is there any techniques or tools to manage this?  How many of these bulk prs have been merged?  KS - his campaign submitted over 60k requests, but a good amount have been merged.  With limited resources, some emails were dropped.  Hard to keep balance.  JL - varying merge rates, most successful one took 4 years to get to 40% merges.  JL uses a gh tracking issue for campaigns.  Api can be scraped to backtrack prs.
        * 
* Goals - the spec doc, coordination of campaigns to avoid overlap, ‚Ä¶what else are we interested in?
    * MS - systemization of the patching of the vulns once they have been disclosed.  Standardization of the metadata between campaigns so info can be inspected by other tooling JL - item #3 touches on this point 
    * MS - is there a way to systematically ID that a patch is for security?  JL - we maybe could leverage the GSD

<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>




* The TAC agreed to provide feedback on the SIRT team. Hopefully that will start getting in during the coming week.
* An OSSF day in OSS NA was announced yesterday at TAC meeting. Encourage everyone to file in CFP.
* First APAC friendly meeting took place with low attendance, partly due to a public holiday in AU at that date.
* The OSV team is based in Australia so we are hoping to better collaborate with them with the APAC friendly meeting.
* OpenVEX discussion is postponed to the next meeting of this group due to conflict of meetings by the maintaining team.
* Proposed projects. We are interested in picking one or two of the list to get participation and start work on them.
    * Incident response playbook (#113)
        * 
    * OSS consumer VDC guide (#115)
        * 
    * Enabling the existing guides, github actions, tooling, etc. (#116)
        * 
    * Anengalize the existing guides and work (#121)
    * Official Secuirty.md and official disclosure process for the foundation(#122)
        * 
    * How finders can share practices and tools/automations between them (#123)
        * Has its own channel already. 
        * Doodle link included above (opens section) for the group‚Äôs meeting time
* Question in chat: Do we have a single place/repository to look for all reported/known vulnerabilities across domains/projects/foundations? Automation tool will be next step
    * Alpha omega are working with github, in the context of their finding, to perhaps keep that as part of github advisories.
* Can hyperledger/blockchain technologies be used in the context of vulnerability disclosure, and in multi participants VD.
    * Hyperledger system is designed to marintain securely data such as that is required for VDs and CVEs 
    * CVSS is designed for maintaining vulnerability scoring with the ability to allow or limit changes to the severity.
    * Perhaps the attestation work that alpha omega is leading can benefit from hyperledger tech.

Meeting Agenda



* New Friends intros
* Who wants to help out and scribe for us today?
* Opens
* Discuss options for next group project/future work for WG
    * Open Source Cert SIG sent for approval and Rob will report back status
    * New instance of this meeting, last Thursday of every month with an APAC friendly time 6pm EST
* VEX - Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange - expressing affectedness thru electronic advisories (Dan Luhring)

        Intro

        * Current tools spreadsheets for tracking issues and not very efficient
        * Machine readable way of analyzing vuln scanning results
    * **Open VEX**
        * VEX is primarily the comms channel for groups.
        * Define a set of min set of requirements needed that‚Äôs applicable to most groups but also have a tool ready that‚Äôs ready to launch
        * Helpful to know: Who is using this? How are they using this?
        * How does the engine know the probability of success of an attack? How is this different than HP Web Inspect?
        * Demo!
            * github.com/openvex
            * Contributors - Chainguard, Google, Anchore, VMWare
            * Sub-Projects
                * spec (JSON)
                    * Vuln
                    * component/package
                    * Overlay this on top of another vuln scan or go the other way to supplement with other info
                * go-vex
                    * Starting point library
                * vexctl
                    * Get up and running quickly but also ingest other VEX formats as well
            * Protobuf spec example of false positives so downstream consumers can use this for their own filtering. I.e. serif data modified with the applied filter
            * E2E example of wolfi. Git package example on Advisories that have been fixed
        * Demo Questions
            * What gaps is this filling in versus other standards like CSAF or CycloneDX? VEX is focusing on minimalism as this is harder to add in later on versus other standards.
            * Why do something new? Trying to get more ubiquitous.
            * Goal - transparent and that vuln scanners are VEX aware. Overtime users will see more accurate vuln reports and spend more time on serious issues. At the same time, find out why something wasn‚Äôt vulnerable as well.
            * Nearly final: Minimum Requirements for Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZPzQUoeoaCTaEmd7nQDf4lCl5ctpsNANh0phNC7IL0/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZPzQUoeoaCTaEmd7nQDf4lCl5ctpsNANh0phNC7IL0/)
            * Any other questions follow up with Dan on slack, email, etc.
        * How are the different formats related and use case for each? I.e. which ones would be most useful for end users‚Äô? (PSIRT, consumers, etc.) Noticed some standards are focused on the commercial side rather than purely open source.
        * Cross collaboration would be extremely useful.
        * Instead of the One Tool to rule them all find out what‚Äôs provided and not provided by each tool 
        * Conversation of different tools will pick up in two weeks
    * CISA community developed docs
        * [https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/VEX_Use_Cases_Aprill2022.pdf](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/VEX_Use_Cases_Aprill2022.pdf)
        * [https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/VEX_Status_Justification_Jun22.pdf](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/VEX_Status_Justification_Jun22.pdf)

* Potentially create a sub-working group of automated vuln fixing at scale - maybe disclosure as well and creating norms around this
    * ( ) Jonathan - create an issue for this in order to collect feedback
    * Is this under Alpha-Omega already? It does some of this but other companies are working on this issue as well. Additionally, AO is not a working group.
    * ( ) Jonathan - create a slack channel for this
        * Send a note to operations@openssf and cc: Crob
* AO needs a disclosure policy for outgoing reports
