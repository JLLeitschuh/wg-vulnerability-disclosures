## Notes

-We are live!
-- Please un-grey yourself if you are attending above in the participants list

- @CRob figure out gdoc sharing
  -- [RH corp infosec rules bar anonymous external access, so this doc got locked for call today]
- @CRob figure out moderator login
  -- Zoom was just too fast to allow me to supply alternate login, so call was not recorded today. Iâ€™ll figure this out.

## Vulnerability disclosures whitepaper (#88)

- Focus on small-to-medium projects. Moderate capabilities/resources
- Pain points for personas
  -- <https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/80>
  -Can we inject multiparty early into the process?
  -Google doc seems to have good overlap; potential to borrow
  -- <https://github.com/google/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/runbook.md>
  -- <https://github.com/google/oss-vulnerability-guide>
  -Guidance must be simple, prescriptive, checklist
- Value in articulating more nuanced use cases
- Create template for community guidelines
  -Jonathan Leitschuh - researcher perspective.
  -- Problem - lots of channels to disclose vulns; very inconsistent execution; hard to keep up with
  -- Each vendor/mechanism has different processes/paths
  -- Researcher public disclosure common practices
  -- Developing Github sec advisories automated disclosure tooling
  -- CRob - the group can help ease pain of acknowledge/details where reporter wants their analysis cited
  -- VINCE platform is a tool that might help ease some of this
  -- Jennifer F highlights high variability of perspectives around disclosure across the community
  -- JL - differences in policies for reporters for bounties. Some vendors require a patch to be published, which goes against idea of not dropping a zero-day
  -- JF - good points we should dig into setting standards/good practice for supply chain coordination
  -- JF - likes idea of body of knowledge with sections focused on issues group is grappling with

## Outcomes

- HOMEWORK - Please review the two google docs describing their open source vuln. Mgmt practices to see if they align with how we desire to deliver our whitepaper project.
  -- <https://github.com/google/oss-vulnerability-guide>
  -- <https://github.com/google/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/runbook.md>
  -- Was asked to make PR to get the stub of the whiteppaer loaded so that people can begin collaborating.
