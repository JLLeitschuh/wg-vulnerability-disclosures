# Agenda & notes

- A little bit of fun first
  - We played the "Two Truths and One Lie" and I think everyone liked it
- Vulnerability disclosure WG: what’s in it for you?
  - @rice: wants to support the initiatives that come out of the group, whatever they are. H1 has a mandate to make it easier to report/distribute/etc. vulnerability data.
  - @crystalhazen: echoing Alex - where can we help?
  - @esarafianou: similarly, wants to support the group. 2 types of work: things we need our companies to execute on, things we can do as a small group. Should we take some each kind of work at the same time?
  - @rice: making metadata actionable, adding “am I actually vulnerable?” metadata and making it actionable
  - @MarcinHoppe:
    - Auth0 is more of a consumer than a producer. Interested in tooling, data, data formats.
    - Another goal: exchange experiences - how other companies are approaching open source security?
    - Collaboration between maintainers and researchers is ripe for improvement
  - @nicowaisman: When we formed the coalition, lots of companies raising the same problems. For this group, “how do I know if I’m actually vulnerable to a CVE?”
    - For my team: interested in everything around vulnerability release. GitHub Security Lab discloses a lot of vulnerabilities - we want to collaborate more with the maintainer and with the potential consumers to give them more actionable data.
- Moving forward: do we try to tell “am I actually vulnerable?” - exploitability assessment
  - Prior art:
    - Rapid7 has an AttackerDB that is attacking the “am I actually vulnerable?” problem <https://attackerkb.com>
    - EPSS WG (@nicowaisman is on it)
- Moving collaboration to GitHub
  - Start discussing ideas in GitHub issues

# Homework

- Add some back-of-napkin thoughts on a problem you think this group could solve in a GitHub issue
- Should we dig into some academic papers too?
