## Meeting minutes

- Welcome new team members
  - Todd Cullum (RedHat)
- Marcin: Last meeting was very full - we touched on many items but haven’t identified where we really want to focus. We identified a couple stakeholders (maintainers for example, security research community, tool vendors that handle disclosures for items they do not own, consumers of vulnerability information) Our goal for today is to have a conversation around pain points for each stakeholder.
- We could start listing pain points and grievances (prior work <https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/blob/main/docs/meeting-notes/2020-10-26.md>)

- **Maintainers**

  - Volunteer effort (best effort) usually - so providing templates that they can follow makes their lives easier - like GitHub auto generate security policy by default. In general not being platform specific but having things you should think about would be helpful. Then partnering with GitHub and GitLab who can put it in to make it easy to use.
  - Marcin: maintainers could be hard to find should they be looked at at the package repository / registry manager level?
    - Npm has done this, but these are also volunteer run
  - People need to consider how to accept both bugs and security issues
  - How do you handle very pushy security researchers [don’t take it personally]
  - A way the community can reach out and get help from security people?
  - Report - very factual format - suggestion avoid free text?
  - Has anyone reviewed the current GitHub security.md file you can not privately report and work. They have it on the roadmap. They have private discussion but not report.

    # Security Policy

    ## Supported Versions

    Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project arecurrently being supported with security updates.

    ## Reporting a Vulnerability

    Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on areported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted ordeclined, etc.

- Art: having just looked at this, my understanding is that it's possible to hack up a shadow/private repo used for security reports, and issues in the private repo can be linked to the public repo
- Envoy ? project might be a good case study (from last week)
- Open JS projects of varying maturity - survey of practices in that community

- **Security Researchers**

  - Node JS working groups and others have been a way for people to report issues to a trusted group of people, who then tries to get a maintainer, or can go to the registry and mark this as having a vulnerability - better coordination. Need to provide the resources to triage the reports.
  - Cases can get pretty tense for the researcher and maintainer.
  - Cover cases when the maintainer fails to respond - what next? Package manager/repository? Host (github/gitlab)

- Marcin - Notes we should maybe work VDP specifically
- Art - Question- this is already worked over space - there might be other things in the disclosure and coordination at scale stuff that applies - things we could target that are less well trodden than disclosure - places to invest that are more valuable - Do see some newer gaps that need work
- Marcin - Next Steps?
